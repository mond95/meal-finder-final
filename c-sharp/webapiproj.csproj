  <!-- I kept getting the error when trying to use dotnet run:
  
The following frameworks were found:
  8.0.0 at [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]

To install missing framework, download:
https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?framework=Microsoft.AspNetCore.App&framework_version=7.0.0&arch=x64&rid=osx-x64&os=osx.12 

But i already installed 7 aswell as 8. But i guess cos it was built on 7 i needed 7 only. Then when i tried on the appstream it worked there because i saw they
used version 7 too.

Anyway by changing the target framework tag below to net8.0 instead it worked!

  <!-- I changed it from net7.0 to net8.0 and it worked -->
